# song-lyrics-generation
Song Lyrics Generator with LSTM in Keras. To get started, download the repository. Then, download songdata.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics and put it into the "data" folder. You will also need to download word vectors from http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip. Unzip it and put the glove.6B.100d.txt file into the "data" folder. <br />
After all that just run train.py to train and generate.py to generate songs. <br />
(Note: the training script is meant to be used for https://floydhub.com, the trained model will appear in the output tab when it is finished training)
